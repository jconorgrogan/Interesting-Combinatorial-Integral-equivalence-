Found some interesting equations:

1.  e * n! - [e * n!] for all n>0 ; The fractional or decimal remainder of the product of e! and n!, beyond the nearest integer value.
2. Recursive Sequence \( u_n \) defined by \( u_{n+1} = -1 + (n+1)u_n \), starting with \( u_0 = e - 1 \
3. Integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^t (1-t)^n \, dt \
4. e (Γ(1 + n) - Γ(1 + n, 1)) (Another way of writing the previous)

They output the factorial sequence (1, 1, 2, 6, 24 all multiplied by e) as well as the total number of permutations of all subsets of an n-set (A000522). A000522 is also related to the Number of operations of addition and multiplication needed to evaluate a determinant of order n by cofactor expansion (A000522-2)

In essence we can think of this, conceptually, as capturing the  fractional growth beyond the integer milestones. In other words, it highlights the excess or remainder of growth that isn't encapsulated within the integer part


**Starting Conditions:**
In other words, you can think of e-1 starting condition as the  proxy for the full growth of something (any process that grows continuously at a constant rate.) for each time period, excluding the original "principal". In other words, what you get leftover when you perform a number of transformations.  
**Stretching + Shrinking**
**Stretching (Multiplication):** The term \( (n+1)u_n \) suggests that as \( n \) increases, the stretching factor (multiplication by \( n+1 \)) grows significantly. This factor becomes larger with each step, implying exponential growth.

**Shrinking (Subtraction):** The constant subtraction of 1, on the other hand, represents a fixed, linear decrement in each step. This shrinking effect remains constant throughout the sequence.

Further, dividing this output by e yields an interesting concept. 

∫₀¹ xⁿ e^{-x} dx


Take, for instance, n=3. 

`f(x) = x^3 e^{-x}`

The derivative of the function \( f(x) = x^3 e^{-x} \) with respect to \( x \) is:

`f'(x) = 3x^2 e^{-x} - x^3 e^{-x}`

Conceptually, You're taking a quantity (in this case, \( x \)), raising it to the third power to cube it, which significantly increases its value, especially for larger values of \( x \). Then you're applying an exponential decay to it with \( e^{-x} \), which shrinks it back down at a rate that increases as \( x \) gets larger. The integral measures how this process affects the area under the curve from the start of the interval at \( x = 0 \) to the end of the interval at \( x = 1 \). This gives you a single value that represents the combined effect of cubing and then exponentially decaying over the entire interval.
