Found an interesting recursive sequence which led me to an integral that also matches the output. The output of each is quite interesting; they output the factorial sequence (1, 1, 2, 6, 24 all multiplied by e) as well as the total number of permutations of all subsets of an n-set (A000522).

Further, dividing this output by e yields an interesting concept. Take, for instance, n=3. 

`f(x) = x^3 e^{-x}`

The derivative of the function \( f(x) = x^3 e^{-x} \) with respect to \( x \) is:

`f'(x) = 3x^2 e^{-x} - x^3 e^{-x}`

Conceptually, You're taking a quantity (in this case, \( x \)), raising it to the third power to cube it, which significantly increases its value, especially for larger values of \( x \). Then you're applying an exponential decay to it with \( e^{-x} \), which shrinks it back down at a rate that increases as \( x \) gets larger. The integral measures how this process affects the area under the curve from the start of the interval at \( x = 0 \) to the end of the interval at \( x = 1 \). This gives you a single value that represents the combined effect of cubing and then exponentially decaying over the entire interval.
